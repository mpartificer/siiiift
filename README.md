# siiiift

### Your AI-powered baking journaling tool

siiiift allows you to connect with other bakers, share recipes, and learn from mistakes. That b√ªche de Noel that you botched last year and ruined the holidays? Find out what went wrong. That most perfect croquembouche that no one thought you could pull off? Share it with a community that gets it. Make the same birthday cake for that one friend every year? Get feedback on how you can make it even more magical at candle time next year.

siiiift is powered by React.js, and borrows from other libraries such as Google Gemini, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, Supabase, and more.
