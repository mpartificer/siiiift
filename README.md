# siiiift

### Your AI-powered baking journaling bestie

siiiift allows you to connect with other bakers, share recipes, and learn from your mistakes. That b√ªche de Noel that you botched last year and ruined the holidays? Find out what went wrong. That most perfect croquembouche that no one thought you could pull off? Share it with a community that gets it. Make the same birthday cake for that one friend every year? Get feedback on how you can make it even more magical at candle time next year.

siiiift is powered by React.js, and borrows from other libraries such as Google Gemini, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, Supabase, and more.

My name is Megan, and I built siiiift because I am so sick of being bad at pie crust.

I owe a huge thanks to my coach for this project Hai Nghiem for keeping me up to date on the coolest new product and offering his techy druidic wisdom at every turn. Additional thanks to the crowd at Get Building and techNL for giving me the opportunity to get better (and solve all of my baking grievances in one fell swoop.)

siiiift will soon have backend support as well so that you can retrieve recipes from the internet as well as from your favourite recipe books.
